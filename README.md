# Counter-Strike Investment Tracker
This project is an investment tracker that calculates your current investments in the game [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://www.counter-strike.net/news). This tool will use the current price on the [Steam market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/) for each item that is inputted.

Users will be able to input certain items from their inventory that they would like to track. This will then show the current values of these items and any changes in value over time. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that will allow you to see the current updated price of your current investments. 

## To get started
First git clone this repository.
```sh
git clone <repo link>
```
Open a terminal/command prompt in the folder. 

Finally run npm start in the main directory.
```sh
npm start
```

### ToDo's
- Find a way to concurrently get the prices for scalability.
- Maybe don't use steam for prices, maybe csgostash.com.
- Add an about, and contact page.
